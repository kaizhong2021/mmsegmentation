## Installation

The compatible MMSegmentation, MMCV and MMEngine versions are as below. Please install the correct versions of them to avoid installation issues.

Notes:

- MMClassification and MMDetatction are optional for MMSegmentation. If you didn't install them, `ConvNeXt` (required MMClassification) and MaskFormer, Mask2Former (required MMDetection) cannot be used. We recommend to install them with source code. Please refer to [MMClasssication](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmclassification) and [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) for more details about their installation.

- To install MMSegmentation 0.x and master branch, please refer to [the faq 0.x document](https://mmsegmentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#installation) to check compatible versions of MMCV.

## How to know the number of GPUs needed to train the model

- Infer from the name of the config file of the model. You can refer to the `Config Name Style` part of [Learn about Configs](../user_guides/1_config.md). For example, for config file with name `segformer_mit-b0_8xb1-160k_cityscapes-1024x1024.py`, `8xb1` means training the model corresponding to it needs 8 GPUs, and the batch size of each GPU is 1.
- Infer from the log file. Open the log file of the model and search `nGPU` in the file. The number of figures following `nGPU` is the number of GPUs needed to train the model. For instance, searching for `nGPU` in the log file yields the record `nGPU 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7`, which indicates that eight GPUs are needed to train the model.
